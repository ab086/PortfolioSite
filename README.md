## Notice for "HackLang" Code
This is a current bug with Github's Linguist functionality. If Linguist sees PHP files that are either empty or missing PHP tags (or if the tags are empty), it mistakenly believes the file is a HackLang file, as HackLang uses the .php extension. The .gitattributes file should override this, but I can't guarantee it's a perfect fix.
