                <h3><a href="https://gulfnorthernxpress.com/" target="_blank">Gulf Northern Xpress</a> is a trucking company located within the Midwestern United States. They have never had a website before until I built one for them!<br>The main focus of the website is for hiring, thus I created them forms that will allow emails to be sent to hiring managers. The forms also implement security, so scripting attacks can't happen.<br><strong>This project took about 1 month to complete.</strong></h3>
